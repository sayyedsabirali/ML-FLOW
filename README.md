# MLflow Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning code snippets while exploring **MLflow**, an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

> Note: This is **not a complete project** â€” it includes only basic examples and experiments I followed while learning MLflow for practice purposes.
